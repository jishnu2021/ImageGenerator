# ImageGenerator
This project harnesses the power of OpenAI's API key to create diverse and imaginative images based on user input. Built with Python Flask for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend, this repository contains the codebase for a web application where users can interact with the image generation model through an intuitive interface.
